===================================
Welcome to Monasca's Documentation!
===================================

The monitoring requirements in OpenStack environments are vast, varied, and
highly complex. Monasca's project mission is to provide a
monitoring-as-a-service solution that is multi-tenant, highly scalable,
performant, and fault-tolerant. Monasca provides an extensible platform for
advanced monitoring that can be used by both operators and tenants to gain
operational insights about their infrastructure and applications.

Monasca uses REST APIs for high-speed metrics, logs processing and querying. It
integrates a streaming alarm engine, a notification engine and an aggregation
engine.

The use cases you can implement with Monasca are very diverse. Monasca follows
a micro-services architecture, with several services split across multiple
repositories. Each module is designed to provide a discrete service in the
overall monitoring solution and can be deployed or omitted according to
operators/customers needs.

Architecture
============

The following illustration provides an overview of Monasca's metrics pipeline
and the interaction of the involved components. For information on Monasca's
log pipeline, refer to
`this wiki page <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Monasca/Logging>`_.
